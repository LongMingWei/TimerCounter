# TimerCounter
- A simple React app to simulate a timer and increasing/decreasing counter, use the Switch Mode button to switch between them
- Stopwatch is self-explanatory
- Counter is in increasing mode by default, whether the counter can increase or decrease can also be changed when the counter is paused
